# functional-programming-for-engineers
An attempt at showcasing how Engineers can use Functional Programming to solve real world problems

## Getting started
```
npm install
```

## Building
```
npm run build-production
```
Then open `./dist/index.html` in your favorite browser.

## Watch
I am a noob with front bundlers etc., the best workflow I got so far is to open 2 watchers in parallel terminals to resp. watch PureScript and JavaScript files:
```
npm run watch-ps
```
and
```
npm run watch-js
```
Then open `./dist/index.html` in your favorite browser.
